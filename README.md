The core Python agent (agent.py) acts as an AI conversational assistant that only speaks Spanish. It listens to user speech, detects grammar errors, and provides constructive feedback in English to help users improve their Spanish grammar. Technologies like OpenAI (LLM), Deepgram (speech-to-text), Cartesia (text-to-speech), and noise cancellation are integrated to enable rich, real-time interaction.
